# Handle app activation


\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \]


Learn how to handle app activation by overriding the [**OnLaunched**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242335) method..

## Override the launch handler

When an app is activated, for any reason, the system sends the [**Activated**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br225018) event. For a list of activation types, see the [**ActivationKind**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224693) enumeration.

The [**Windows.UI.Xaml.Application**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242324) class defines methods you can override to handle the various activation types. Several of the activation types have a specific method that you can override. For the other activation types, override the [**OnActivated**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242330) method.

Define the class for your application.

```xml
<Application xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
             xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml"
             x:Class="AppName.App" >
```

Override the [**OnLaunched**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242335) method. This method is called whenever the user launches the app. The [**LaunchActivatedEventArgs**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224731) parameter contains the previous state of your app and the activation arguments.

**Note**  For Windows Phone Store apps, this method is called each time the user launches the app from Start tile or app list, even when the app is currently suspended in memory. On Windows, launching a suspended app from Start tile or app list doesnâ€™t call this method.

> End Class

> using namespace Windows::UI::Xaml;
> using namespace AppName;
> void App::OnLaunched(LaunchActivatedEventArgs^ args)
> {
>    EnsurePageCreatedAndActivate();
> }
>
> // Creates the MainPage if it isn't already created.  Also activates
> // the window so it takes foreground and input focus.
> void App::EnsurePageCreatedAndActivate()
> {
>     if (_mainPage == nullptr)
>     {
>         // Save the MainPage for use if we get activated later
>         _mainPage = ref new MainPage();
>     }
>     Window::Current->Content = _mainPage;
>     Window::Current->Activate();
> }
> ```

## Restore application data if app was suspended then terminated


When the user switches to your terminated app, the system sends the [**Activated**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br225018) event, with [**Kind**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224728) set to **Launch** and [**PreviousExecutionState**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224729) set to **Terminated** or **ClosedByUser**. The app should load its saved application data and refresh its displayed content.

> [!div class="tabbedCodeSnippets"]
> ```cs
> async protected override void OnLaunched(LaunchActivatedEventArgs args)
> {
>    if (args.PreviousExecutionState == ApplicationExecutionState.Terminated ||
>        args.PreviousExecutionState == ApplicationExecutionState.ClosedByUser)
>    {
>       // TODO: Populate the UI with the previously saved application data
>    }
>    else
>    {
>       // TODO: Populate the UI with defaults
>    }
>
>    EnsurePageCreatedAndActivate();
> }
> ```
> ```vb
> Protected Overrides Sub OnLaunched(args As Windows.ApplicationModel.Activation.LaunchActivatedEventArgs)
>    Dim restoreState As Boolean = False
>
>    Select Case args.PreviousExecutionState
>       Case ApplicationExecutionState.Terminated
>          ' TODO: Populate the UI with the previously saved application data
>          restoreState = True
>       Case ApplicationExecutionState.ClosedByUser
>          ' TODO: Populate the UI with the previously saved application data
>          restoreState = True
>       Case Else
>          ' TODO: Populate the UI with defaults
>    End Select
>
>    Window.Current.Content = New MainPage(restoreState)
>    Window.Current.Activate()
> End Sub
> ```
> ```cpp
> void App::OnLaunched(Windows::ApplicationModel::Activation::LaunchActivatedEventArgs^ args)
> {
>    if (args->PreviousExecutionState == ApplicationExecutionState::Terminated ||
>        args->PreviousExecutionState == ApplicationExecutionState::ClosedByUser)
>    {
>       // TODO: Populate the UI with the previously saved application data
>    }
>    else
>    {
>       // TODO: Populate the UI with defaults
>    }
>
>    EnsurePageCreatedAndActivate();
> }
> ```

If the value of [**PreviousExecutionState**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224729) is **NotRunning**, the app failed to save its application data successfully and the app should start over as if it were being initially launched.

## Remarks

> **Note**  For Windows Phone Store apps, the [**Resuming**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242339) event is always followed by [**OnLaunched**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br242335), even when your app is currently suspended and the user re-launches your app from a primary tile or app list. Apps can skip initialization if there is already content set on the current window. You can check the [**LaunchActivatedEventArgs.TileId**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/br224736) property to determine if the app was launched from a primary or a secondary tile and, based on that information, decide whether you should present a fresh or resume app experience.
