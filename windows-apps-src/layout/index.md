Check out these recommendations for structuring your app and using the three types of UI elements: navigation, command, and content.

<b>[Navigation basics](navigation-basics.md)</b><br/>
Navigation in UWP apps is based on a flexible model of navigation structures, navigation elements, and system-level features. This article introduces you to these components and shows you how to use them together to create a good navigation experience.
</p>
<p>
<b>[Content basics](content-basics.md)</b><br/>
The main purpose of any app is to provide access to content: in a photo-editing app, the photo is the content; in a travel app, maps and info about travel destinations is the content; and so on. This article provides content design recommendations for the three content scenarios: consumption, creation, and interaction.
</p> 
  </div>
  <div class="side-by-side-content-right">
<p><b>[Command basics](commanding-basics.md)</b> <br />
Command elements are the interactive UI elements that enable the user to perform actions, such as sending an email, deleting an item, or submitting a form. This article describes the command elements, such as buttons and check boxes, the interactions they support, and the command surfaces (such as command bars and context menus) for hosting them.</p>

The number of device targets and screen sizes across the Windows 10 ecosystem is too great to worry about optimizing your UI for each one. Instead, we recommended designing for a few key widths (also called "breakpoints"): 360, 640, 1024 and 1366 epx.</p>
