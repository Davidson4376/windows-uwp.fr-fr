#  Using cloud services for UWP games

The Universal Windows Platform (UWP) in Windows 10 offers a set of APIs that can be used for developing games across Microsoft devices. When developing games across platforms and devices, you can make use of a cloud backend to help scale your game according to demand.

##  What is cloud computing?

Cloud computing uses on demand IT resources and applications over the internet to store and process data for your devices. The term _cloud_ is a metaphor for the availability of vast resources out there (not local resources) that you can access from non-specific locations.
The principle of cloud computing offers a new way in which resources and software can be consumed. Users no longer need to pay for the full complete product or resources upfront, but instead are able to consume platform, software, and resources as a service. Cloud providers often bill their customers according to usage or service plan offerings.

##  Why use cloud services?

One advantage of using cloud services for games is that you do not need to invest in physical hardware servers upfront, but only need to pay according to usage or service plans at a later stage. It is one way to help manage the risks involved in developing a new game title. 

Another advantage is that your game can tap into vast cloud resources to achieve scalability (effectively manage any sudden spikes in the number of concurrent players, intense real-time game calculations or data requirements). This keeps the performance of your game stable around the clock. Furthermore, cloud resources can be accessed from any device running on any platform anywhere in the world, which means that you are able to bring your game to everyone globally.

Delivering an amazing gameplay experience to your players is important. Because game servers running in the cloud are independent of client-side updates, they can give you a more controlled and secure environment for your game overall.   You can also achieve gameplay consistency through the cloud by never trusting the client and having server side game logic. Service-to-service connections can also be configured to allow a more integrated gaming experience; examples include linking in-game purchases to various payment methods, bridging over different gaming networks, and sharing in-game updates to popular social media portals such as Facebook and Twitter. 

You can also use dedicated cloud servers to create a large persistent game world, build up a gamer community, collect and analyze gamer data over time to improve gameplay, and optimize your game's monetization design model.

In addition, games that require intensive game data management capabilities like social games with asynchronous multiplayer mechanics can be implemented using cloud services.

## How to design your cloud backend

While producers and game designers are in discussion about what game features and functionalities are needed in the game, it is good to start considering how you want to design your game infrastructure. The Azure Cloud can be used as your game backend when you want to develop games for various devices and across different major platforms.

* [Using Azure Mobile Engagement for Unity iOS deployment](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/mobile-engagement-unity-ios-get-started/)

### Understanding IaaS, PaaS or SaaS

First, you need to think about the level of service that is best suited for your game. Knowing the differences in the following three services can help you determine the approach you want to take in building your backend.

* [Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-iaas/)

    Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the Internet. Imagine having the possibility of many machines readily available to quickly scale up and down depending on demand. IaaS helps you to avoid the cost and complexity of buying and managing your own physical servers and other datacenter infrastructure.

* [Platform as a Service (PaaS)](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/what-is-paas/)

    Platform as a Service (PaaS) is like IaaS but it also includes management of infrastructure like servers, storage, and networking. So on the top of not buying physical servers and datacenter infrastructure, you also do not need to buy and manage software licenses, underlying application infrastructure, middleware, development tools, or other resources.

* Software as a Service (SaaS)

    Software as a Service is normally an application already built for you and hosted on an existing cloud platform. It is designed to make it even easier for you to start running your game on their service.


### Design your game infrastructure using Azure
