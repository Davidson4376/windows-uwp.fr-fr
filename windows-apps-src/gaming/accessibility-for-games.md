#  Making games accessible

Accessibility can empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more, and this applies to making games more accessible too. This article is written for game developers; specifically game designers, producers, and managers. It provides an overview of game accessibility guidelines derived from various organizations (listed in the reference section below), and introduces the inclusive game design principle for creating more accessible games.

##  Why make games accessible?

### Increased gamer base

At its most basic level, the business justification for accessibility is straightforward:

Number of users who can play your game x Awesomeness of game = Game sales

If you made an amazing game that is so complicated or convoluted that only a handful of people can play it, you limit your sales. Similarly, if you made a game that is unplayable by those with physical, sensory, or cognitive impairments, you are missing out on potential sales. Considering that, for example, [19% of people in the United States have some form of disability](http://www.census.gov/newsroom/releases/archives/miscellaneous/cb12-134.html), this can potentially have a large impact on your title’s revenue. 

For more business justifications, see [Making Video Games Accessible](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ee415219).

### Better games

Creating a more accessible game can create a better game in the end. 

An example is subtitles in games. In the past, games rarely supported subtitles or closed captioning for game dialogues. Today, it’s expected that games include subtitles and closed captioning. This change was not driven by gamers with disabilities. Instead, it was driven by gamers who simply preferred to play with subtitles because it made the gaming experience better. Gamers turn subtitles and closed captioning on when they are playing with too much background noise, are having difficulty hearing voices with various sound effects or ambient sounds playing at the same time, or when they simply need to keep the volume low to avoid disturbing others. Subtitles and closed captions not only helped gamers to have a better gaming experience, but it also allows people with hearing disabilities to game as well.

Controller remapping is another feature that is slowly becoming a standard for the game industry for similar reasons. Gamers enjoy customizing their gaming experiences. What most people don’t realize is that the ability to remap buttons on an input device is actually an accessibility feature that was intended to make a game playable for people with various types of motor disabilities.

Ultimately, the thought process used to make your game more accessible will often result in a better game because you have designed a more user-friendly, customizable experience for your players to enjoy.

### A social space

Gaming is a form of entertainment and can provide hours of joy. For some, gaming is not only a form of entertainment but it is an escape from a hospital bed, chronic pain, or debilitating social anxiety. Gamers are transported into a world where they become the main characters in the video game. Through gaming, they can create and participate in a social space for themselves that provides distraction from the day-to-day struggles brought on by their disabilities, and that provides an opportunity to communicate with people they might otherwise be unable to interact with.

##  Is the game you are making today accessible?

If you are thinking about making your game accessible for the first time, here are some questions to ask yourself:

* Can you complete the game using a single hand? 
* Can an average person be able to pick the game up and play?
* Can you effectively play the game on a small monitor or TV sitting at a distance?
* Do you support more than one type of input device that can be used to play through the entire game?
* Can you play the game with sound muted?
* Can you play the game with your monitor set to black and white?

If your answers are mostly no, or you do not know the answers, it is time to step up and put accessibility into your game.

## Defining disability

Disability is defined as "a mismatch between the needs of the individual and the service, product or environment offered." ([Inclusive video](https://www.microsoft.com/design/inclusive), Microsoft.com.) This means that anyone can experience a disability, and that it can be a short-term or situational condition. Envision what challenges gamers with these conditions might have when playing your game, and think about how your game can be better designed for them. Here are some disabilities to consider:

### Vision

*   Medical, long-term conditions like glaucoma, cataracts, color blindness, near-sightedness, and diabetic retinopathy
*   Short-term, situational conditions like a small monitor or screen size, a low resolution screen, or screen glare due to bright light sources on a monitor
        
### Hearing

* Medical, long-term conditions like complete deafness or partial hearing loss due to diseases or genetics
* Short-term, situational conditions like excessive background noise, or restricted volume to avoid disturbing others
        
### Motor

* Medical, long-term conditions like Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), arthritis, and muscular dystrophy
* Short-term, situational conditions like an injured hand, holding a beverage, or carrying a child in one arm
  
### Cognitive

* Medical, long-term conditions like dyslexia, epilepsy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), dementia, and amnesia
* Short-term, situational conditions like lack of sleep, or temporary distractions like siren from an emergency vehicle driving by the house

### Speech

* Medical, long-term conditions like vocal cord damage, dysarthria, and apraxia
* Short-term, situational conditions like dental work, or eating and drinking


## How to make games more accessible?

### Design shift: Inclusive game design approach

Inclusive design focuses on creating products and services more accessible to a broader spectrum of consumers, including people with disabilities.

To be successful, today’s game designers need to think beyond creating fun games for a small, targeted audience. Game designers need to be aware of how their design decisions impact the overall accessibility of the game; the playability of the game for their overall potential audience, including those with disabilities.

As such, traditional game design paradigms must shift to embrace the inclusive game design concept. Inclusive game design means going beyond the basic game design of creating fun for the target audience, to creating additional or modified personas to include a wider spectrum of players. 

This extra step helps to identify gaps in the original design. By identifying gaps, you can iterate on the original design concept and make it better. When you take the time to be more inclusive in your game design process, your final game becomes more accessible.

### Empower gamers: Give gamers options

Accessibility is all about options. Give your gamers the options to customize their gaming experience. If you already have a huge fan base, you may have a significant portion of your audience who do not want the experience to change in any way. That’s okay. Give your gamers the ability to turn these features on and off, and make features configurable individually.

### Innovate: Be creative

There are many creative ways to improve the accessibility of your game. Put on your creative hat and learn from other accessible games out there. If you already have an existing game, learn to identify current game features that could be improved while keeping the core game mechanics and experience as designed. As mentioned above, accessibility in games is all about providing gamers with options to customize their gaming experience.

### Evangelize: Make accessibility a priority in your game studio

Game development is always running on a tight timeline, so prioritizing accessibility will help make it an easier process. One way is to design from the start with accessibility in mind. Share your knowledge about accessibility with your team, and share the business justifications.

### Review: Constantly evaluate your game

During development, you can introduce a review process to make sure that at every step of the way you are thinking about accessibility. Make a checklist like the one below to help your team constantly evaluate whether what you are creating is accessible or not.

| Checklist                                         | Accessibility features                                                                                                         |
|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| In-game cinematics                                | Has subtitles and captions, photosensitivity tested                                                                           |
| Overall artwork (2D and 3D graphics)              | Colorblind friendly colors and options, not dependent entirely on color for identification but use shapes and patterns as well|
| Start screen, settings menu and other menus       | Ability to read options aloud, ability to remember settings, alternate command control input method, adjustable UI font size  |
| Gameplay                                          | Wide adjustable difficulty levels, subtitles and captions, good visual and audio feedback for gamer                           |
| HUD display                                       | Adjustable screen position, adjustable font size, colorblind friendly option                                                  |        
| Control input                                     | Mappable controls to input device, custom controller support, simplified input for game allowed                               |        

### Playtest and iterate: Get gamers' feedback

When organizing playtesting sessions, invite play testers with disabilities that your game is designed for and get them to play your game. Observe how they play and get feedback from them. Figure out what changes need to be made to make the game better.

### Shout it out: Let the world know your game is accessible

Consumers will want to know if your game can be played by gamers with disabilities. State the game’s accessibility clearly on the game website and packaging to ensure that consumers know what to expect when they buy your game. Remember to make your website and all sales channels to the game accessible as well. Most importantly, reach out to the accessibility gaming community and tell them about your game.

## Game accessibility features

This section outlines some features that can make your game more accessible. These features are derived from guidelines taken from the [Game accessibility guidelines](http://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com/), which represent the findings of a collaborative group of studios, specialists, and academics. For more information, see [Game accessibility guidelines](http://gameaccessibilityguidelines.com/). 

### Colorblind friendly graphics and user interface

The retina of the eye has two types of light-sensitive cells: the cones for seeing where there is light, and the rods for seeing in low light conditions. There are three types of cones (red, green, and blue) to enable us to view colors correctly. Colorblindness occurs when one or more of these three types light cones is not functioning as expected. The degree of colorblindness can range from almost normal color perception with reduced sensitivity towards red, green, or blue light, to a complete inability to perceive red, green, or blue color. Since it’s less common to have reduced sensitivity to blue light, when designing for the colorblind, the selection of colors are geared towards people who are red or green colorblind:
 
  + Use color combinations that can be differentiated by people with red/green colorblindness:
  
    * Colors that appear similar: All shades of red and green including brown and orange
    * Colors that stand out: Blue and yellow
    
  + Do not rely solely on color to distinguish game objects—use shapes and patterns as well
  
### Closed captioning and subtitles

When designing the closed captions and subtitles for your game, the objective is provide readable captions as an option so that your game can also be enjoyed without audio. It should be possible to have game components like game dialogues, game audio, and sound effects displayed as text on screen.

Here are some basic guidelines to consider when designing closed captions and subtitles:

*   Select simple readable font.
*   Select sufficiently large font size, or consider having adjustable font size option for more flexibility. (Ideal font size depends on screen size, viewing distance from screen, and so on.)
*   Create high contrast between background and font color. (For more information, see [Information on contrast ratio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/accessibility/accessible-text-requirements).)
* Display short sentences on screen. (Remember not to give the game away by displaying the text before event occurs.)
*   Differentiate what is making the sound or who is talking. (Example: "Daniel: Hi!")
*   Provide the option to turn closed captions and subtitles on and off. (Additional feature: Ability to select how much sound information is displayed based on importance.)

### Sound feedback

Sound provides feedback to the player, in addition to visual feedback. Good game audio design can improve accessibility for players with visual impairment. Here are some guidelines to consider:

*   Use 3D audio cues to provide additional spatial information.
* Separate music, speech and sound effects volume controls.
*   Design speech that provides meaningful information for gamers. (Example: "Enemies are approaching" vs. "Enemies are entering from the back door.")
*   Ensure speech is spoken at a reasonable rate, and provide rate control for better accessibility.

### Fully mappable controls

There are companies and organizations, such as [Special Effect](http://www.specialeffect.org.uk/), that design custom game controllers that can be used with various gaming systems like Windows and Xbox One. This customization allows people with different forms of disabilities to play games they might not be able to play otherwise. For more information on people who are now able to play games independently because of customized controllers, see [who they helped](http://www.specialeffect.org.uk/who-we-helped).

As a game developer, you can make your game more accessible by allowing fully mappable controls so that gamers have the option to plug in their custom controllers and remap the keys according to their needs.

Both standard Xbox One and Xbox Elite controllers offer customization of the controllers for precision gaming. For more information, see [Xbox One](http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/customize-standard-controller-with-accessories-app) and [Xbox Elite](http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/accessories/use-accessories-app-configure-elite-controller).

### Wider selection of difficulty levels

Video games provide entertainment. The challenge for game developers is to tune the difficulty level such that the gamer experiences the right amount challenge. Firstly, not all gamers have the same skill level and capability, so designing a wider selection of difficulty options increases the chance of providing gamers with the right amount of challenge. At the same time, this wider selection also makes your video game more accessible because it could potentially allow more people with disabilities to play your game. Remember, gamers want to overcome challenges in a game and be rewarded for it. They do not want a game that they cannot win.

Tweaking the difficulty level of your game is a delicate process. If it is too easy, gamers might get bored. If it is too difficult, gamers may give up and not play any further from that point on. The balancing process is both art and science. There are many ways to make a game level that has the right amount of challenge. Some games offer simplified inputs, like a single button press game option for their game, a rewind and replay option to make gameplay more forgiving, or less and weaker enemies to make it easier to proceed forward after several tries.

### Photosensitivity epilepsy testing

Photosensitive epilepsy (PSE) is a condition where seizures are triggered by visual stimuli like exposures to flashing lights or certain moving visual forms and patterns. This occurs in about three percent of people and is more common in children and adolescents.

There are many factors that can cause a photosensitive reaction when playing video games, including the duration of gameplay, the frequency of the flash, the intensity of the light, the contrast of the background and the light, the distance between the screen and the gamer, and the wavelength of the light.

As a developer, here are some tips for designing a game to include gamers who have the tendency for photosensitive epilepsy:

*   Avoid having flashing lights with a frequency of 5 to 30 flashes per second (Hertz) because flashing lights in that range are most likely to trigger seizures.
*   Use an automated system to check gameplay for stimuli that could trigger photosensitive epilepsy. (Example: [Harding Flash and Pattern Analyzer (FPA) G2](http://www.hardingfpa.com/harding-fpa-for-games/) developed by Cambridge Research System Ltd and Professor Graham Harding.) 
*   Design for breaks between game levels, encouraging players to take a break from playing non-stop.
