# App settings and data

This section contains user experience guidelines for presenting app settings and storing those settings as app data.

*App settings* are the user-customizable portions of your Universal Windows Platform (UWP) app. For example, a news reader app might let the user specify which news sources to display or how many columns to display on the screen.

*App data* is data that the app itself creates and manages. It includes runtime state, app settings, reference content (such as the dictionary definitions in a dictionary app), and other settings. App data is tied to the existence of the app and is only meaningful to that app.
