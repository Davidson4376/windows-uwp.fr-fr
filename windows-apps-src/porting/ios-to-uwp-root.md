# Move from iOS to UWP

\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \]

**Reuse your Objective-C code with the Windows Bridge for iOS**

-   This guide is designed to help you port your iOS app to Windows 10 manually. If your app is written entirely in Objective-C, you can alternatively use the Windows Bridge for iOS to quickly move your app to Windows 10 while reusing much of your existing code. The iOS bridge enables you to build Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps in Visual Studio 2015 using Objective-C code and iOS API libraries. You can also use the bridge to extend your Objective-C code with unique Windows 10 features like Cortana and Live Tiles.

If you already know Windows, and want to expand your reach to iOS, take a look at Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. With integral support for mobile application development based on Xamarin, you can now create apps for iOS devices from within Visual Studio, compiling and running code using a paired Mac computer. Visual Studio can become the heart of your mobile development world, sharing code and development tools between Windows, Android and iOS.
