[Get the Desktop App Converter.](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=785437)

Desktop App Converter is a pre-release tool that enables you to bring your existing desktop apps written for .NET 4.6.1 or Win32 to the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). You can run your desktop installers through the converter in an unattended (silent) mode and obtain an AppX package that you can install by using the Add-AppxPackage PowerShell cmdlet on your development machine.

The converter runs the desktop installer in an isolated Windows environment using a clean base image provided as part of the converter download. It captures any registry and file system I/O made by the desktop installer and packages it as part of the output. The converter outputs an AppX with package identity and the ability to call a vast range of WinRT APIs.

## System requirements

### Supported operating system
+ Windows 10 Anniversary Update Enterprise edition preview (Build 10.0.14316.0 and later)

### Required hardware configuration

Your computer must have the following minimum capabilities:
+ 64 bit (x64) processor
+ Hardware-assisted virtualization
+ Second Level Address Translation (SLAT)

### Recommended resources
+ [Windows Software Development Kit (SDK) for Windows 10](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk)

## Set up the Desktop App Converter   
Desktop App Converter relies on Windows 10 features that are flighted as part of the Windows Insider Preview builds. Make sure that you're on the latest build to utilize the converter.

1. Ensure that you have the latest Windows 10 Insider Preview OS - Enterprise edition (Build 10.0.14316.0 and up).
2. Download the DesktopAppConverter.zip and the BaseImage-14316.wim.
3. Extract the DesktopAppConverter.zip to a local folder.
4. From an admin PowerShell window:  
```CMD
PS C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy bypass
```
5. Run the following command from an admin PowerShell window to setup the converter:
```CMD
PS C:\> .\DesktopAppConverter.ps1 -Setup -BaseImage .\BaseImage-14316.wim
```
6. If running the previous command prompts you to reboot, restart your machine and run the command again.

## Run the Desktop App Converter
Desktop App Converter has two entry points: PowerShell and Command Shell. You can use either of these entry points to start the conversion process.

### Usage
```CMD
DesktopAppConverter.ps1
-ExpandedBaseImage <String>
-Installer <String> [-InstallerArguments <String>] [-InstallerValidExitCodes <Int32>]
-Destination <String>
-PackageName <String>
-Publisher <String>
-Version <Version>
[-AppExecutable <String>]
[-AppFileTypes <String>]
[-AppId <String>]
[-AppDisplayName <String>]
[-AppDescription <String>]
[-PackageDisplayName <String>]
[-PackagePublisherDisplayName <String>]
[-MakeAppx]
[-NatSubnetPrefix <String>]
[-LogFile <String>]
[<CommonParameters>]  
```

### Example
The following example shows how to convert a desktop app named *MyApp* by *&lt;publisher_name&gt;* to a UWP package (AppX).

+ From an admin PowerShell window, run the following command:
```CMD
PS C:\>.\DesktopAppConverter.ps1 -ExpandedBaseImage C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Images\BaseImage-14316
â€“Installer C:\Installer\MyApp.exe -InstallerArguments "/S" -Destination C:\Output\MyApp
-PackageName "MyApp" -Publisher "CN=<publisher_name>" -Version 0.0.0.1 -MakeAppx -Verbose
```

## Deploy your converted AppX
Use the [Add-AppxPackage](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh856048.aspx) cmdlet in PowerShell to deploy a signed app package (.appx) to a user account. To sign your .appx package, refer to the following section, "Signing your .Appx Package". Also, you can include the *Register* parameter of the cmdlet to install from a folder of unpackaged files during the development process. For more info, see [Deploy and debug your converted UWP app](desktop-to-uwp-deploy-and-debug.md).

## Sign your .Appx Package

The Add-AppxPackage cmdlet requires that the application package (.appx) being deployed must be signed. Use SignTool.exe, which ships in the Microsoft Windows 10 SDK, to sign the .appx package.

### Example
```CMD
C:\> MakeCert.exe -r -h 0 -n "CN=<publisher_name>" -eku 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.3 -pe -sv <my.pvk> <my.cer>
C:\> pvk2pfx.exe -pvk <my.pvk> -spc <my.cer> -pfx <my.pfx>
C:\> signtool.exe sign -f <my.pfx> -fd SHA256 -v .\<outputAppX>.appx
```
**Note:** When you run MakeCert.exe and you're asked to enter a password, select **None**.

For more info on certificates and signing, see:

+ [How to: Create Temporary Certificates for Use During Development](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms733813.aspx)
+ [SignTool](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa387764.aspx)
+ [SignTool.exe (Sign Tool)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/8s9b9yaz.aspx)

### Caveats
1. The Windows 10 build on the host machine must match the base image that you obtained as part of the Desktop App Converter download.  
2. Ensure that the desktop installer is in an independent directory, because the converter copies all of the directory's content to the isolated Windows environment.  
3. Currently, the Desktop App Converter supports running the conversion process on a 64-bit operating system only. You can deploy the converted .appx packages to a 64-bit (x64) OS only.  
4. Desktop App Converter requires the desktop installer to run under unattended mode. Ensure that you pass the silent flag for your installer to the converter by using the *-InstallerArguments* parameter.  

## Telemetry from Desktop App Converter  
Desktop App Converter may collect information about you and your use of the software and send this info to Microsoft. You can learn more about Microsoft's data collection and use in the product documentation and in the [Microsoft Privacy Statement](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839). You agree to comply with all applicable provisions of the Microsoft Privacy Statement.

By default, telemetry will be enabled for the Desktop App Converter. Add the following registry key to configure telemetry to a desired setting:  
```CMD
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\DesktopAppConverter
```
+ Add or edit the *DisableTelemetry* value by using a DWORD set to 1.
+ To enable telemetry, remove the key or set the value to 0.
