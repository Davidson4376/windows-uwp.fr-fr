## Launch the compose email dialog

Create a new [**EmailMessage**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn631270) object and set the data that you want to be pre-populated in the compose email dialog. Call [**ShowComposeNewEmailAsync**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Dn631269) to show the dialog.

``` cs
private async Task ComposeEmail(Windows.ApplicationModel.Contacts.Contact recipient, 
    string messageBody, 
    StorageFile attachmentFile)
{
    var emailMessage = new Windows.ApplicationModel.Email.EmailMessage();
    emailMessage.Body = messageBody;

    if (attachmentFile != null)
    {
        var stream = Windows.Storage.Streams.RandomAccessStreamReference.CreateFromFile(attachmentFile);

        var attachment = new Windows.ApplicationModel.Email.EmailAttachment(
            attachmentFile.Name,
            stream);

        emailMessage.Attachments.Add(attachment);
    }

    var email = recipient.Emails.FirstOrDefault<Windows.ApplicationModel.Contacts.ContactEmail>();
    if (email != null)
    {
        var emailRecipient = new Windows.ApplicationModel.Email.EmailRecipient(email.Address);
        emailMessage.To.Add(emailRecipient);
    }

    await Windows.ApplicationModel.Email.EmailManager.ShowComposeNewEmailAsync(emailMessage);
        
}
```
