# App submissions


Once you've [created your app by reserving a name](create-your-app-by-reserving-a-name.md), you can start working on getting it published. The first step is to create a **submission**.

You can start your submission when your app is complete and ready to publish, or you can start entering info even before you have written a single line of code. The submission will be saved in your dashboard, so you can work on it whenever you're ready.

After your app is published, you can publish an updated version by creating another submission in your dashboard. Creating a new submission lets you make and publish whatever changes are needed, whether you're uploading new packages or just changing details such as price or category. To create a new submission for an app, click **Update** next to the most recent submission shown on the App overview page.

## App submission checklist


Here are the details that you can provide when creating your app submission, with links to more info.

Items that you are required to provide or specify are noted below. Some areas are optional, or have default values provided that you can change as desired.
