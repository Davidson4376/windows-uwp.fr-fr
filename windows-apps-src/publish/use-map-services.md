# Use map services


To use map services in apps for Windows Phone 8.1 and earlier, you need a map service application ID and a token to include in your app's code. You can get this token in the Dev Center dashboard on the **Maps** page in the **Services** section.

> **Note**  To use map services in apps targeting other operating systems, visit the [Bing Maps Dev Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=614880). See [Request a maps authentication key](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt219694) for more info.

Once you've [reserved your app's name](create-your-app-by-reserving-a-name.md), look for the **Services** section in the left navigation menu and expand it to show the **Maps** page. When you click **Get token**, the **ApplicationID** and **AuthenticationToken** will be generated and will appear on this page.

> **Note**  You donâ€™t have to finish submitting your app at this time. After you request a token and ID, this info will be saved on this page. You can return to this page at any time to access this info.

You'll also need to make sure to add the **ApplicationID** and **AuthenticationToken** to your code before you package and submit your app. For more info, see [How to add a Map control to a page (Windows Phone 8.1)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=614882).
