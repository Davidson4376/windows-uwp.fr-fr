# Create add-on Store listings


When submitting an add-on, the info you provide in the **Store listings** step will be displayed to your customers when they see the option to acquire your add-on. Make sure to consider the Store listing info carefully in order to represent your add-on accurately in a way that makes it appealing to customers. You can provide customized Store listings for different languages.

## Languages


Before you can enter Store listing info, you need to specify one or more [languages](supported-languages.md). We recommend providing Store listings for every language your app supports.

Under the **Store listing** section of your add-on's submission, click **Manage Store listing languages**, then click **Manage languages** on the next page. Check the boxes for the languages that you’d like to add, then click **Update**. The languages that you’ve selected will be displayed in the **Store listing languages** section of the page. To remove one or more of these languages, click **Remove** (or click **Manage languages** and uncheck the box for languages you’d like to remove). Click **Save** when you're happy with the list of languages.

> **Tip** To add and remove additional languages, click **Manage Store listing languages** from the add-on submission overview.

To edit a Store listing, click the language name on the add-on submission overview. The info you can enter for each language is described below.

## Title

You must provide a title here, which is the name your customers will see for this add-on. Your title can be up to 100 characters.

## Description

If you'd like to display more info than just a title, you can enter up to 200 characters here. This field is optional.

## Icon

You also have the option to provide an image that may be displayed to the customer. This icon must be a .png file that measures exactly 300 x 300 pixels.
