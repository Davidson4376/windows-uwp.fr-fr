# Analytics

You can view detailed analytics for your apps in the Windows Dev Center dashboard. Statistics and charts let you know how your apps are doingâ€”from how many customers you've reached to how they're using your app and what they have to say about it. You can also find info on app health, ad usage, and more. View the reports in the dashboard, or [download the reports you need](download-analytic-reports.md) to analyze your data offline.

> **Note**  In addition to the dashboard reports, you can programmatically access some analytics data by using the [Windows Store analytics REST API](../monetize/access-analytics-data-using-windows-store-services.md).

## Analytics for all your apps


Your dashboard overview page also includes a roll-up view to gather details about all your apps. The stats shown on the overview page will vary, depending on your apps.

When you [download analytic reports](download-analytic-reports.md), you also have the option to download reports about all of your apps. Note that you will need to access the **Download reports** page in the **Analytics** section for one of your apps, but you are not limited to downloading data only for that particular app.

## Available reports for each app


In this section you'll find details about the info presented in each of the following reports:

-   [Acquisitions report](acquisitions-report.md)
-   [Health report](health-report.md)
-   [Ratings report](ratings-report.md)
-   [Reviews report](reviews-report.md)
-   [Usage report](usage-report.md)
-   [IAP acquisitions report](iap-acquisitions-report.md)
-   [Ad mediation report](ad-mediation-report.md)
-   [Advertising performance report](advertising-performance-report.md)
-   [App install ads report](app-install-ads-reports.md)
-   [Channels and conversions report](channels-and-conversions-report.md)

> **Note**  You may not see data in all of these reports, depending on your app's specific features and implementation.

## Page and section filters

Each report includes filters that you can use to drill down into your data. Near the top of the page you'll see **Apply filters**. You can use these filters to limit or expand the scope of all of the charts and info on the page.

Within each particular chart, you may also see individual section filters. These will limit the data shown only for that particular chart.

The specific filters vary by report. The topics in this section will explain which filters are available and will describe the other data on the page for each report.
