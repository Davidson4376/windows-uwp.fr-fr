# Managing your account settings and profile info

You can view and update your developer account settings and profile info in the **Account settings** section of the [unified Windows Dev Center dashboard](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Mt169843).

## Account settings

The **Account settings** page shows details about your account, and includes links to other pages where you can view and/or update info.

In the **Account details** section, you can see the status and type of your account. You can also find your publisher ID info on this page including your Seller ID, Windows publisher ID, and Windows Phone publisher ID. These values are assigned by Microsoft to uniquely identify your developer account, and you cannot edit these values.

**Note**  Identity details for your individual apps can be found in the [App identity](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Mt148561) page for each app.

## Contact info

The **Contact info** section displays the info you provided when setting up your account. We use this info to contact you about your account.

You can edit this section if any of your contact info has changed. Note that changing this info may require us to verify your account again, especially if you have a company account. Your verification status will show as **Pending** while this is in process. The verification process can take from a few days to a couple of weeks, and often includes a phone call to your company from our verification partners Symantec or Dun & Bradstreet (so make sure your contact information is up to date).

If you change your publisher display name, weâ€™ll need to verify your account again. If you do this after you have published an app, you'll need to modify the publisher display name in your app's packages and submit the app again using the updated packages after your account has been reverified.

## Additional settings and info

This section also includes links to [set up your payout account and tax forms](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/Bg124529). You'll need to do this before you can charge money for apps or in-app products (IAPs).

Some programs may provide a code to let you expand the capabilities of your account; these can be entered in **Account settings**. This page also lets you view details for any [Windows Phone 8 or Windows Phone 8.1 devices that you've unlocked for testing](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=533897) and enable or disable app usage telemetry for use with Visual Studio Application Insights.
