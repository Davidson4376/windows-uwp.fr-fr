# pubCenter-DevCenter payout account and tax profile consolidation


If you had previously set up a pubCenter payout account for your Microsoft Advertising earnings, that account will no longer be used for payments as of April 1st, 2016. Payments are now made through your Dev Center payout account.

> **Important** As of October 1st, 2016, you will no longer have access to the pubCenter dashboard. Please visit your [Windows Dev Center dashboard](https://developer.microsoft.com/dashboard/apps/overview) for all ad management and reporting. If you haven’t linked any of your pubCenter accounts to a Dev Center account, please do so immediately. For more info, see [pubCenter-Dev Center integration](pubcenter-dev-center-integration.md).

To ensure any payments due are submitted on time, please sign in to your Dev Center dashboard and confirm that your [payout account and tax profile](setting-up-your-payout-account-and-tax-forms.md) are set up correctly and are up to date.

> **Important**  If you have never set up your payout account or tax profile in Dev Center, you’ll need to do that in order to receive payments. For more info, see [Setting up your payout account and tax forms](setting-up-your-payout-account-and-tax-forms.md).

For more info about payments in Dev Center, see [Payout summary](payout-summary.md). For info about currencies used for payouts in different countries and regions, see [Developer account and app-submission markets](account-types-locations-and-fees.md#account_markets).
