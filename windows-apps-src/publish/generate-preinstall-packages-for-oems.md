# Generate preinstall packages for OEMs


If your developer account has been granted the appropriate permissions, you can generate and download preinstall packages that an OEM can use to include your app in their image. Preinstall permissions are only enabled on developer accounts that are sponsored by OEMs.

## Important preinstall policy & limitations


Preinstall apps must be certified through Windows Dev Center to have the latest Store license so that they are able to connect to the Store and receive app updates.

Any app that is already preinstalled must be and remain free in all markets.

## Generating preinstall packages


Once an account has been enabled with preinstall permissions, complete the following steps:

1.  In your dashboard, navigate to the app that is to be preinstalled.
2.  In the left navigation menu, expand **App management** and then click **Current packages**.
3.  In the **Request packages for OS preinstallation** section, click **Enable downloadable packages**.
4.  A confirmation dialog will appear, noting that apps preinstalled on an OS prior to Windows 10 must be free. Select **Enable.**
5.  Find the package that you want to download, and click the appropriate **Generate package** link.
    > **Note**  Generation time for preinstall packages will vary depending on the size of the package you have selected. You can leave this page and come back later, or leave the page open.
6.  When the package has been generated, a link to **Download package** will appear. Click this link to download the .zip file.

You can then provide this .zip file to the OEM for inclusion in their OS image.
