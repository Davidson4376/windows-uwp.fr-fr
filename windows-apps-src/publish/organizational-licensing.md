# Organizational licensing options


You can indicate whether and how your app can be offered for volume purchases through the Windows Store for Business in the **Organizational licensing** section of the [Pricing and availability](set-app-pricing-and-availability.md#organizational-licensing) page of an app submission.

Through these settings, you can opt to allow your app to be made available to organizations who acquire and deploy multiple licenses for their users, providing an opportunity to increase your reach to Windows 10 organizations across device types, including PCs, tablets and phones. You will also need to allow organizational licensing for [line-of-business (LOB) apps](distribute-lob-apps-to-enterprises.md) that you publish directly to enterprises.

> **Note**  Selections for each of your apps are configured independently from each other. You may change your preferences for an app at any time by creating a new submission, and your changes will take effect after the submission completes the [certification process](the-app-certification-process.md).
 
> **Important**  At this time, only free apps will be offered for volume acquisition. Selections you make for paid apps will take effect at a later date, once support is added for acquiring paid apps in volume. 

## Allowing your app to be offered to organizations


By default, the box labeled **Make my app available to organizations with Store-managed (online) volume licensing** is checked. This means that you wish your app to be available for inclusion in catalogs of apps that will be made available to organizations for volume acquisition, with app licenses managed through the Store's online licensing system.

> **Note**  This does not guarantee that your app will be made available to all organizations.

If you prefer not to allow us to offer your app to organizations for volume acquisition, uncheck this box. Note that this change will only take place after the app completes the certification process. If any organizations had previously acquired licenses to your app, those licenses will still be valid, and the people who have the app already can continue to use it.

## Allowing disconnected (offline) licensing


Many organizations need apps enabled for offline licensing. For example, some organizations need to deploy apps to devices which rarely or never connect to the internet. If you want to allow your app to be made available to these customers, check the box labeled **Allow disconnected (offline) licensing for organizations**.

> **Note**  This box is unchecked by default; you must check the box to allow us to make your app available to verified organizations who will install it using disconnected licensing.

Offline licensing allows organizations to acquire your app on a volume basis, and then install the app without requiring each device to contact the Store's licensing system.
The organization is able to download your app's package along with a license which lets them install it to devices (via their own management tools or by preloading apps on OS images) without notifying the Store when a particular license has been used. Enabling this scenario greatly increases deployment flexibility, and it may substantially increase the attractiveness of your app with these customers.

>**Note**  Organizations must go through additional validation in order to install paid apps to their end users in this way.
 
> **Tip**  To publish line-of-business (LOB) apps exclusively to a specific organization, you can set up an enterprise association and allow the organization to add the apps directly their private store. For more info, see [Distribute LOB apps to enterprises](distribute-lob-apps-to-enterprises.md).
