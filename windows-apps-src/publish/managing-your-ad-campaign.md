# Managing your ad campaign


To manage your app's ad campaigns, click **Monetization** &gt; **Promote your app** from your app's page in the Windows Dev Center dashboard. The **Promote your app** page lists all of the ad campaigns associated with your app and displays the impressions, clicks, and installs for each ad campaign. For more information about impressions, clicks, and installs, see the definitions for these terms in [App install ads report](app-install-ads-reports.md).

To filter the list of ad campaigns, click the **Section filters** drop-down and choose from the following filters:

-   **Date**: This specifies the data range for impressions, clicks, and installs that are associated with the ad campaigns.
-   **Status**: This specifies the status of the ad campaigns:
    -   **Active** indicates that the ad campaign is running and processing data. To temporarily pause an ad campaign, click **Pause** in the **Action** column of the ad campaigns table.
    -   **Paused** indicates that the ad campaign is temporarily on hold and not processing data. To resume an ad campaign, click **Resume** in the **Action** column of the ad campaigns table.
    -   **Ended** indicates that the ad campaign has reached the end date you specified when you created or last modified the ad campaign.
    -   **Needs attention** indicates that the ad campaign has issues that need your attention, such as a billing failure or a custom ad design that failed validation. To fix the issues, click the text in the **Action** column of the ad campaigns table.
-   **Campaign type**: This specifies whether to display paid or [house](about-house-ads.md) ad campaigns.

## Report


To see how your ad campaigns are performing, click **Analytics** &gt; **App install ads** in the navigation pane of the dashboard. For more information about this report, see [App install ads report](app-install-ads-reports.md).

## Edit an ad campaign


To make changes to an ad campaign, click its name to go to the details page for that ad campaign. After you make changes, click **Review**, review the details, and then click **Confirm**.
