# Common questions about ad campaigns


## How much does it cost to run an ad for my app?


Itâ€™s really up to you, but remember: the more you spend, the more people will see your ad. The more people see your ad, the more clicks and installs you should get. Take a look at [this article](create-an-ad-campaign-for-your-app.md) for information on creating an ad campaign for your app.

## Can I run ads for one of my apps in my other apps?


Yes. We call these *house ads*, and you can run them free of charge. Check out [this article](about-house-ads.md) for more information on house ads.

## How can I customize my ad?


If you use one of the default ad templates, you can choose the size, imagery, and background color of your ad. You can also add a custom tag line to your ad if you want. Alternatively, you can upload your own ad designs that meet our requirements. For more information, see [Create an ad campaign for your app.](create-an-ad-campaign-for-your-app.md)
