# Create app descriptions


The **Descriptions** section of the [app submission process](app-submissions.md) is where you provide the text and [images](app-screenshots-and-images.md) that customers will see in your app's Store listing.

Unlike the rest of the info in your app's submission, you can't access the **Descriptions** step until you [upload your app packages](upload-app-packages.md). This is because we need to detect which [languages](supported-languages.md) your app supports. We'll add a page for you to provide your **Description** info for each language supported by your app. You must complete the **Description** page for at least one language, though we recommend providing them for each language supported by your app. To specify whether or not you will provide a description for each language supported in your app's packages, click **Manage languages**.

Many of the fields in the **Description** are optional, but we suggest providing multiple images and as much info as possible to make your listing stand out. The minimum required for the **Description** step to be considered complete is a text description and at least one [screenshot](app-screenshots-and-images.md).

By default, we'll use the same description (per language) for all of your targeted operating systems. If you'd like to use a customized description for a specific operating system, you can [create platform-specific descriptions](create-platform-specific-descriptions.md).

## Default description fields


At the top of the **Description** page, we show you the fields associated with your **Default description**. These fields will be shown to all of your customers, unless you [create platform-specific descriptions](create-platform-specific-descriptions.md). If you do so, you'll see these fields repeated under section headings for each targeted OS for which you've created a platform-specific description, underneath your **Default description** (which will be displayed to customers on Windows 10, as well as customers on any OS that your app supports for which you haven't created a custom description). Make sure each field in the **Default description** section is filled out with all the info you want to display to your app's customers (even if you want some of these fields to show the same info across different operating systems).

For more info, see [Create platform-specific descriptions](create-platform-specific-descriptions.md).

### Description

The description field is where you can tell customers what your app does. This field is required, and will accept up to 10,000 characters of plain text.

For some tips on making your description stand out, see [Write a great app description](write-a-great-app-description.md).

### Release notes

If this is the first time you're submitting your app, you'll probably want to leave this field blank. For an update to an existing app, this is where you can let customer know what's changed in the latest release. This field has a 1500 character limit.

### Screenshots

In most cases, you'll see multiple fields to provide screenshots for different types of devices. You are not required to provide separate screenshots for each device type; only one screenshot is required for your submission (though you can provide up to nine per device type). In most cases we suggest providing screenshots on as many device types as your app supports, so that customers will see images that resemble how the app will look on their device.

For more info, see [App screenshots and images](app-screenshots-and-images.md).

### App tile icon

The app tile icon is used when displaying your app's listing to customers on Windows Phone 8.1 and earlier (and is used in your app's listing for customers on Windows 10 if you only have packages targeting Windows Phone 8.1 or earlier). This must be a .png file measuring 300 x 300 pixels.

### App features

These are short summaries of your app's key features. They are displayed to the customer as a bulleted list in your app's listing, along with its description. Keep these brief, with just a few words (and no more than 200 characters) per feature. You may include up to 20 features.

**Note**  These will appear bulleted in the listing, so don't add your own bullets.

 

### Recommended hardware

Describe the hardware configurations that your app requires to work properly. This is especially important if your app requires hardware that might not be available on every computer. They are displayed to the customer as a bulleted list in your app's listing. Keep these brief, with just a few words (and no more than 200 characters) per item. You may include up to 11 items.

**Note**  These will appear bulleted in the listing, so don't add your own bullets.

 

## Shared fields


The fields in the **Shared fields** section can't be customized for a specific platform, unlike the fields shown above. The items described below are all shared fields and will apply to all of your descriptions in a given language, regardless of operating system, even if you [create platform-specific descriptions](create-platform-specific-descriptions.md).

### Keywords

Keywords are single words or short phrases that are not displayed to customers, but can help your app appear in search results related to the keyword. You can include up to 8 keywords with a maximum of 45 characters each.

If you want to add keywords, think about the words that customers might use when searching for apps like yours, especially if they're not part of your app's name. Be sure not to use any keywords that are not actually relevant to your app.

### Copyright and trademark info

If you'd like to provide additional copyright and/or trademark info, enter it here. This field has a 200 character limit.

### Additional license terms

Leave this field blank if you want your app to be licensed to customers under the terms of the **Standard Application License Terms** (which are linked to from the [App Developer Agreement](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh694058)).

If your license terms are different from the **Standard Application License Terms**, enter them here.

If you enter a single URL into this field, it will be displayed to customers as a link that they can click to read your additional license terms. This is useful if your additional license terms are very long, or if you want to include clickable links or formatting in your additional license terms.

You can also up to 10,000 characters of text in this field. If you do that, customers will see these additional license terms displayed as plain text.

### Website

Enter the URL of the web page for your app. This URL must point to a page on your own website, not your app's web listing in the Store.

### Support contact info

Enter the URL of the web page where your customers can go for support on your app, or an email address that customers can contact for support.

**Important**  Microsoft doesn't provide your customers with support for your app.

 

### Privacy policy

If you have a privacy policy for your app, enter its URL here. You are responsible for ensuring your app complies with privacy laws and regulations and for providing a privacy policy, if required.

**Important**  Microsoft doesn't provide a default privacy policy for your app. Likewise, your app is not covered by any Microsoft privacy policy. To determine if your app requires a privacy policy, review the [App Developer Agreement](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/hh694058) and the [Windows Store Policies](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn764944.aspx#pol_10_5_1).
