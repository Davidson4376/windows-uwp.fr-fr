# <a name="create-customer-segments"></a>Create customer segments

There are times when you may want to target a subset of your customer base for promotional and engagement purposes. You can accomplish this in Windows Dev Center by creating a type of [customer group](create-customer-groups.md) known as a *segment* that includes the Windows 10 customers who meet the demographic or revenue criteria that you choose.

For example, you could create a segment that includes only customers who are age 50 or older, or that includes customers who’ve spent more than $10 in the Windows Store. You could also combine these criteria and create a segment that includes all customers over 50 who have spent more than $10 in the Store. We provide a few segment templates to help get you started, but you can define and combine the criteria however you'd like.

> **Tip** Segments can be used to [send targeted push notifications](send-push-notifications-to-your-apps-customers.md) to a group of customers as part of an engagement campaign.

## <a name="to-create-a-customer-segment"></a>To create a customer segment

1.  In the [Windows Dev Center dashboard](https://developer.microsoft.com/dashboard/overview), select **Customers** in the top menu.
2.  On the **Customer groups** page, do one of the following:
 - In the **My customer groups** section, select **Create new group** to define a segment from scratch. Be sure that **Segment** is selected in the **Group type** dropdown list.
 - In the **Segment templates** section, select **Copy to use a predefined segment** that you can use as is or modify to suit your needs.
3.  In the **Include customers from this app** list, select one of your apps to target.
4.  In the **Segment name** box, choose a name for your segment.
5.  In the **Define inclusion conditions** section, choose the filter criteria for the segment.

    You can choose from a variety of filter criteria, including **Acquisition source**, **Acquisitions**, **Demographic**, **Rating**, **Store acquisitions**, **Store purchases**, and **Store spend**.

    For example, if you wanted to create a segment that only included your app customers who are 18- to 24-years old, you’d select the filter criteria [**Demographic**] [**Age group**] [**is**] [**18 to 24**] from the drop-down lists.

    You can build more complex segments by using AND/OR queries to include or exclude customers based on various attributes. To add an OR query, select **+ OR statement**. To add an ADD query, select **Add another filter**.

    So, if you wanted to refine that segment to only include male customers who are in the specified age range, you would select **Add another filter** and then select the additional filter criteria [**Demographic**] [**Gender**] [**is**] [**Male**]. For this example, the **Segment definition** would display **Age group == 18 to 24 && Gender == Male**.

6. Select **Save**.

> **Important** You won't be able to use a segment that includes too few customers. If your segment definition does not include enough customers, you can adjust the segment criteria, or try again later, when your app may have acquired more customers that meet your segment criteria.

Things to keep in mind about customer segments:
- After you save a segment, it takes 24 hours before you’ll be able to use it for [targeted push notifications](send-push-notifications-to-your-apps-customers.md).
- Segment results are refreshed daily, so you may see the total count of customers in a segment change from day to day as customers drop in or out of the segment criteria.
- Most of these attributes are calculated using all historical data, although there are some exceptions. For example, **App acquisition date**, **Campaign ID**, **Store page view date**, and **Referrer URI domain** are limited to the last 90 days of data.
- The segment will only include customers who have acquired your app on Windows 10. If your app supports older OS versions, customers using those older OS versions will not be included in any segments you create.
- Segments automatically exclude any customers who are younger than 17 years old.


## <a name="app-statistics"></a>App statistics

The **App statistics** section on the segment provides some info about your app, as well as the size of the segment you just created.

Note that **Available app customers** does not reflect the actual number of customers who have acquired your app, but only the number of customers that are available to be included in segments (that is, customers that we can determine meet age requirements, have acquired your app on Windows 10, and who are associated with a valid Microsoft account).

If you view the results and **Customers in this segment** says **Small**, the segment doesn't include enough customers and the segment is marked inactive. Inactive segments can't be used for notifications or other features. You might be able to activate and use a segment by doing one of the following:

- In the **Define inclusion conditions** section, adjust the filter criteria so the segment includes more customers.
- On the **Customer groups** page, in the **Inactive segments** section, select **Refresh** to see if the segment currently contains enough customers. This tactic might work, for example, if more customers who meet your segment criteria have downloaded your app since you first created the segment.
