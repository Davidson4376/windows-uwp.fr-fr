| Topic | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Packaging UWP apps](packaging-uwp-apps.md) | To sell your UWP app or distribute it to other users, you need to create an appxupload package for it. When you create the appxupload, another appx package will be generated to use for testing and sideloading. You can distribute your app directly by sideloading the appx package to a device. This article describes the process of configuring, creating and testing a UWP app package. For more information about sideloading, see [Sideload Apps with DISM](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=231020). |
| [Create an app package with the MakeAppx.exe tool](create-app-package-with-makeappx-tool.md) | MakeAppx.exe creates, encrypts, decrypts, and extracts files from app packages and bundles. |
| [Install apps with the WinAppDeployCmd.exe tool](install-universal-windows-apps-with-the-winappdeploycmd-tool.md) | Windows Application Deployment (WinAppDeployCmd.exe) is a command line tool that can use to deploy a UWP app from a Windows 10 machine to any Windows 10 Mobile device. You can use this tool to deploy an .appx package when the Windows 10 Mobile device is connected by USB or available on the same subnet without needing Microsoft Visual Studio or the solution for that app. This article describes how to install UWP apps using this tool. |
| [Set up automated builds for your UWP app](auto-build-package-uwp-apps.md) | If you want to package your app as part of an automated build process, this topic shows you how to use Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) to do it. |
| [App capability declarations](app-capability-declarations.md) | Capabilities must be declared in your UWP app's [package manifest](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/BR211474) to access certain API or resources like pictures, music, or devices like the camera or the microphone. |
| [Download and install package updates for your app](self-install-package-updates.md) | Your UWP app can programmatically check for package updates and install the updates. Your app can also query for packages that have been marked as mandatory on the Windows Dev Center dashboard and disable functionality until the mandatory update is installed. This article describes how to perform these tasks. |
