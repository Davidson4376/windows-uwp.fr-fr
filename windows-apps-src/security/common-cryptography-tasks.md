# Common cryptography tasks


\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \]

These articles provide example code for common Universal Windows Platform (UWP) cryptography tasks, such as creating random numbers, comparing buffers, converting between strings and binary data, copying to and from byte arrays, and encoding and decoding data.
