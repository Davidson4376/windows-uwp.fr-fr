# Data access

\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \]

This section discusses storing data on the device in a private database and using object relational mapping in Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps.

SQLite is included in the UWP SDK. Entity Framework 7 works with SQLite in UWP apps. Use these technologies to develop for offline / intermittent connectivity scenarios, and to persist data across app sessions.

| Topic | Description|
|-------|------------|
| [Entity framework 7 with SQLite for C# apps](entity-framework-7-with-sqlite-for-csharp-apps.md) | Entity Framework (EF) is an object-relational mapper that enables you to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. This article explains how you can use Entity Framework 7 with a SQLite database in a Universal Windows app. |
| [SQLite databases](sqlite-databases.md) | SQLite is a server-less, embedded database engine. This article explains how to use the SQLite library included in the SDK, package your own SQLite library in a Universal Windows app, or build it from the source. |
