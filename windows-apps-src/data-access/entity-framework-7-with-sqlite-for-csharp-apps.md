# Entity framework 7 with SQLite for C# apps

\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \]

Entity Framework (EF) is an object-relational mapper that enables you to work with relational data using domain-specific objects. This article explains how you can use Entity Framework 7 with a SQLite database in a Universal Windows app.

Originally for .NET developers, Entity Framework 7 can be used with SQLite on Universal Windows Platform (UWP) to store and manipulate relational data using domain specific objects. You can migrate EF code from a .NET app to a UWP app and expect it work with appropriate changes to the connection string.

Currently EF only supports SQLite on UWP. A detailed walkthrough on installing Entity Framework 7, and creating models is available at the [Getting Started on Universal Windows Platform page](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=735013). It covers the following topics:

-   Prerequisites
-   Create a new project
-   Install Entity Framework
-   Create your model
-   Create your database
-   Use your model
