# Get set up

It's easier than you think to get going. Follow these instructions and start creating Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps for Windows 10.

> [!NOTE]
> Are you a Mac user? Or maybe you don't want to install anything on your PC just yet? Try the [web-based virtual machines set up for Build2016's coding challenges](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/projects/events/build2016/all/codingchallenges).


## 1. Get Windows 10

To develop UWP apps, you need the latest version of Windows.

-   [Get Windows 10 online](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=619312)

Are you an MSDN subscriber? You can get ISO downloads here:

-   Get Windows 10 from [MSDN Subscriber Downloads](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=266384)



## 2. Download or update Visual Studio

Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 helps you design, code, test, and debug your apps.

If you don't already have Visual Studio 2015, click this link to install the free Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2015. This download includes device and phone simulators for testing your apps:

-   [Download Windows 10 developer tools](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=534189)

When you install Visual Studio, use the custom option and make sure all Universal Windows App Development Tools options are selected, as shown here.

## 3. Enable your device for development

Itâ€™s important to test your UWP apps on a real PCs and phones. Before you can deploy apps to your PC or Windows Phone, you have to enable it for development.

-   For detailed instructions, see [Enable your device for development](enable-your-device-for-development.md).

## 4. Register as an app developer

You can start developing apps now, but before you can submit them to the store, you need a developer account.

-   To get a developer account, go to the [Sign up](sign-up.md) page.

## What's next?

After you've installed the tools and gotten a developer license or a developer account, use our tutorials to create your first app:
