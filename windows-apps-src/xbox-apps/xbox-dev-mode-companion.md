# Xbox Dev Mode Companion

Xbox Dev Mode Companion allows you to remotely connect to an Xbox One console and control it. This tool was created for developers using Xbox Developer Mode.

## How to get the app  
Download the [Xbox Dev Mode Companion (Preview)](https://www.microsoft.com/store/p/xbox-dev-mode-companion/9nblggh519cp).

## How to connect   
To connect to your console:

1. Launch the app.   
2. If you don't see your console listed in the connection dialog, type your console's IP address in the text box at the bottom of the dialog, and then select **Connect**.

## Streaming controls
After you have connected, you can access the streaming controls by hovering over the streaming area with your mouse. These controls allow you to:
* Toggle between full screen and windowed mode.
* Launch the Windows Device Portal.
* Turn the console on and off.
* Disconnect.

## Input
To send input to your console through the app, you can plug in an Xbox One controller to your PC.   
    
You can also use the arrow, enter, and escape keys on the keyboard to navigate console UI and apps that support keyboard navigation. The Help page has a full keyboard mapping.   
   
Finally, in text boxes, you can type on your keyboard to send text to the console.   

## Help
