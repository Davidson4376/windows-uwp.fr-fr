# Bringing HTML games to UWP on Xbox
Xbox One is an excellent platform for HTML 5 games. HTML 5 games run on the [Edge](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-edge/) browser engine. Edge is fast and fully supports HTML 5 and CSS 3 features such as WebGL and canvas.

Popular game engines such as [Construct 2](https://www.scirra.com/blog/176/announcing-xbox-one-export-beta) have support for Xbox One. We haven't tested every HTML framework and engine, but from what we have seen so far, we believe most of them will work on Xbox One.

HTML games are on a level playing field with any other type of game. Developers can get full access to native APIs such as controller input, Kinect, and more.

Xbox One runs on the Universal Windows Platform and that means that, like other Microsoft devices, it supports Hosted Web Apps, which are applications that come completely from a server. To learn more, see [Hosted Web Apps](http://microsoftedge.github.io/WebAppsDocs/en-US/win10/HWA.htm).

To get started, download your engine of choice and look for instructions for Windows 10 apps. Also be sure to read the [getting started guide](getting-started.md) for information about turning your console into a development kit and how to deploy from Visual Studio.
