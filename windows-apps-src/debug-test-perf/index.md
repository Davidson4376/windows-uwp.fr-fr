| [Deploying and debugging UWP apps](deploying-and-debugging-uwp-apps.md) | This article guides you through the steps to target various deployment and debugging targets. |
| [Test with the Microsoft Emulator for Windows 10 Mobile](test-with-the-emulator.md) | Simulate real-world interaction with a device and test the features of your app by using the tools included with Microsoft Emulator for Windows 10 Mobile. The emulator is a desktop application that emulates a mobile device running Windows 10. It provides a virtualized environment in which you can debug and test Windows apps without a physical device. It also provides an isolated environment for your application prototypes. |
| [Beta testing](beta-testing.md) | **Beta testing** gives you the chance to improve your app based on feedback from individuals outside of your app-development team who try your unreleased app on their own devices. |

| [Performance](performance-and-xaml-ui.md) | Users expect their apps to remain responsive, to feel natural, and not to drain their battery. Technically, performance is a non-functional requirement but treating performance as a feature will help you deliver on your users' expectations. Specifying goals, and measuring, are key factors. Determine what your performance-critical scenarios are; define what good performance mean. Then measure early and often enough throughout the lifecycle of your project to be confident you'll hit your goals. |
