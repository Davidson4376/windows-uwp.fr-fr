# Manage add-on submissions using the Windows Store submission API



Use the following methods in the Windows Store submission API to manage add-on (also known as in-app product or IAP) submissions for apps that are registered to your Windows Dev Center account. For an introduction to the Windows Store submission API, including prerequisites for using the API, see [Create and manage submissions using Windows Store services](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md).

>**Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;These methods can only be used for Windows Dev Center accounts that have been given permission to use the Windows Store submission API. Not all accounts have this permission enabled. Before you can use these methods to create or manage submissions for an add-on, the add-on must already exist in your Dev Center account. You can create an add-on by [using the Dev Center dashboard](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/publish/iap-submissions) or by using the Windows Store submission API methods in described in [Manage add-ons](manage-add-ons.md).

| Method        | URI    | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/inappproducts/{id}/submissions/{submissionId}``` | Gets data for an existing add-on submission. For more information, see [Get an add-on submission](get-an-add-on-submission.md). |
| GET | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/inappproducts/{id}/submissions/{submissionId}/status``` | Gets the status of an existing add-on submission. For more information, see [Get the status of an add-on submission](get-status-for-an-add-on-submission.md). |
| POST | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/inappproducts/{id}/submissions``` | Creates a new add-on submission for an app that is registered to your Windows Dev Center account. For more information, see [Create an add-on submission](create-an-add-on-submission.md). |
| POST | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/inappproducts/{id}/submissions/{submissionId}/commit``` | Commits a new or updated add-on submission to Windows Dev Center. For more information, see [Commit an add-on submission](commit-an-add-on-submission.md). |
| PUT | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/inappproducts/{id}/submissions/{submissionId}``` | Updates an existing add-on submission. For more information, see [Update an add-on submission](update-an-add-on-submission.md). |
| DELETE | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/inappproducts/{id}/submissions/{submissionId}``` | Deletes an add-on submission. For more information, see [Delete an add-on submission](delete-an-add-on-submission.md). |

## Create an add-on submission

To create a submission for an add-on, follow this process.

1. If you have not yet done so, complete the prerequisites described in [Create and manage submissions using Windows Store services](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md), including associating an Azure AD application with your Windows Dev Center account and obtaining your client ID and key. You only need to do this one time; after you have the client ID and key, you can reuse them any time you need to create a new Azure AD access token.  

2. [Obtain an Azure AD access token](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md#obtain-an-azure-ad-access-token). You must pass this access token to the methods in the Windows Store submission API. After you obtain an access token, you have 60 minutes to use it before it expires. After the token expires, you can obtain a new one.

3. Execute the following method in the Windows Store submission API. This method creates a new in-progress submission, which is a copy of your last published submission. For more information, see [Create an add-on submission](create-an-add-on-submission.md).

  ```
  POST https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/inappproducts/{id}/submissions
  ```

  The response body contains three items: the ID of the new submission, the data for the new submission (including all the listings and pricing information), and the shared access signature (SAS) URI for uploading any add-on icons for the submission. For more information about SAS, see [Shared Access Signatures, Part 1: Understanding the SAS model](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1/).

4. If you are adding new icons for the submission, [prepare the icons](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/publish/create-iap-descriptions#icon) and add them to a ZIP archive.

5. Update the submission data with any required changes for the new submission, and execute the following method to update the submission. For more information, see [Update an add-on submission](update-an-add-on-submission.md).

  ```
  PUT https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/inappproducts/{id}/submissions/{submissionId}
  ```

  >**Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are adding new icons for the submission, make sure you update the submission data to refer to the name and relative path of these files in the ZIP archive.

4. If you are adding new icons for the submission, upload the ZIP archive to the SAS URI that was provided in the response body of the POST method you called in step 2. For more information, see [Shared Access Signatures, Part 2: Create and use a SAS with Blob storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-2/).

  The following code snippet demonstrates how to upload the archive using the [CloudBlockBlob](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/microsoft.windowsazure.storage.blob.cloudblockblob.aspx) class in the Azure Storage Client Library for .NET.

  ```csharp
  string sasUrl = "https://productingestionbin1.blob.core.windows.net/ingestion/26920f66-b592-4439-9a9d-fb0f014902ec?sv=2014-02-14&sr=b&sig=usAN0kNFNnYE2tGQBI%2BARQWejX1Guiz7hdFtRhyK%2Bog%3D&se=2016-06-17T20:45:51Z&sp=rwl";

  Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob.CloudBlockBlob blockBob =
      new Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob.CloudBlockBlob(new System.Uri(sasUrl));
  await blockBob.UploadFromStreamAsync(stream);
  ```

5. Commit the submission by executing the following method. This will alert Dev Center that you are done with your submission and that your updates should now be applied to your account. For more information, see [Commit an add-on submission](commit-an-add-on-submission.md).

  ```
  POST https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/inappproducts/{id}/submissions/{submissionId}/commit
  ```

6. Check on the commit status by executing the following method. For more information, see [Get the status of an add-on submission](get-status-for-an-add-on-submission.md).

  ```
  GET https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/inappproducts/{id}/submissions/{submissionId}/status
  ```

  To confirm the submission status, review the *status* value in the response body. This value should change from **CommitStarted** to either **PreProcessing** if the request succeeds or to **CommitFailed** if there are errors in the request. If there are errors, the *statusDetails* field contains further details about the error.

7. After the commit has successfully completed, the submission is sent to the Store for ingestion. You can continue to monitor the submission progress by using the previous method, or by visiting the Dev Center dashboard.
