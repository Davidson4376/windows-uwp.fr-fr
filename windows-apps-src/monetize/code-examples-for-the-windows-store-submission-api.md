# Code examples for the Windows Store submission API

This section provides code examples for using the *Windows Store submission API* in several different programming languages. 

Use the Windows Store submission API to programmatically query and create submissions for apps, add-ons and package flights for your or your organization's Windows Dev Center account. This API is useful if your account manages many apps or add-ons, and you want to automate and optimize the submission process for these assets. For more information about this API, see [Create and manage submissions using Windows Store services](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md).
