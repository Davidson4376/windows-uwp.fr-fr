# Get app data using the Windows Store submission API

Use the following methods in the Windows Store submission API to get data for apps that are registered to your Windows Dev Center account. For an introduction to the Windows Store submission API, see [Create and manage submissions using Windows Store services](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md).

>**Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;These methods can only be used for Windows Dev Center accounts that have been given permission to use the Windows Store submission API. Not all accounts have this permission enabled. These methods can only be used to get data for apps. To create or manage submissions for apps, see the methods in [Manage app submissions](manage-app-submissions.md).

| Method        | URI    | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/applications``` | Retrieves data for all the apps that are registered to your Windows Dev Center account. For more information, see [Get all apps](get-all-apps.md). |
| GET | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/applications/{applicationId}``` | Retrieves data about a specific app that is registered to your Windows Dev Center account. For more information, see [Get an app](get-an-app.md). |
| GET | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/applications/{applicationId}/listinappproducts``` | Lists the add-ons (also known as in-app products or IAPs) for an app that is registered to your Windows Dev Center account. For more information, see [Get add-ons for an app](get-add-ons-for-an-app.md). |
| GET | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/applications/{applicationId}/listflights``` | Lists the package flights for an app that is registered to your Windows Dev Center account. For more information, see [Get package flights for an app](get-flights-for-an-app.md). |
