# Manage app submissions using the Windows Store submission API




Use the following methods in the Windows Store submission API to manage submissions for apps that are registered to your Windows Dev Center account. For an introduction to the Windows Store submission API, including prerequisites for using the API, see [Create and manage submissions using Windows Store services](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md).

>**Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;These methods can only be used for Windows Dev Center accounts that have been given permission to use the Windows Store submission API. Not all accounts have this permission enabled.


| Method        | URI    | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/applications/{applicationId}/submissions/{submissionId}``` | Gets data for an existing app submission. For more information, see [Get an app submission](get-an-app-submission.md). |
| GET | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/applications/{applicationId}/submissions/{submissionId}/status``` | Gets the status of an existing app submission. For more information, see [Get the status of an app submission](get-status-for-an-app-submission.md). |
| POST | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/applications/{applicationId}/submissions``` | Creates a new submission for an app that is registered to your Windows Dev Center account. For more information, see [Create an app submission](create-an-app-submission.md). |
| POST | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/applications/{applicationId}/submissions/{submissionId}/commit``` | Commits a new or updated app submission to Windows Dev Center. For more information, see [Commit an app submission](commit-an-app-submission.md). |
| PUT | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/applications/{applicationId}/submissions/{submissionId}``` | Updates an existing app submission. For more information, see [Update an app submission](update-an-app-submission.md). |
| DELETE | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/applications/{applicationId}/submissions/{submissionId}``` | Deletes an app submission. For more information, see [Delete an app submission](delete-an-app-submission.md). |

## Create an app submission

To create a submission for an app, follow this process.

1. If you have not done so already, complete all the [prerequisites](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md#prerequisites) for the Windows Store submission API.

  >**Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure the app already has at least one completed submission with the [age ratings](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/publish/age-ratings) information completed.

3. [Obtain an Azure AD access token](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md#obtain-an-azure-ad-access-token). You must pass this access token to the methods in the Windows Store submission API. After you obtain an access token, you have 60 minutes to use it before it expires. After the token expires, you can obtain a new one.

4. Execute the following method in the Windows Store submission API. This method creates a new in-progress submission, which is a copy of your last published submission. For more information, see [Create an app submission](create-an-app-submission.md).

  ```
  POST https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/applications/{applicationId}/submissions
  ```

  The response body contains three items: the ID of the new submission, the data for the new submission (including all the listings and pricing information), and the shared access signature (SAS) URI for uploading any app packages and listing images for the submission. For more information about SAS, see [Shared Access Signatures, Part 1: Understanding the SAS model](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-1/).

3. If you are adding new packages or images for the submission, [prepare the app packages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/publish/app-package-requirements) and [prepare the app screenshots and images](https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/publish/app-screenshots-and-images). Add all of these files to a ZIP archive.

4. Update the submission data with any required changes for the new submission, and execute the following method to update the submission. For more information, see [Update an app submission](update-an-app-submission.md).

  ```
  PUT https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/applications/{applicationId}/submissions/{submissionId}
  ```

  >**Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are adding new packages or images for the submission, make sure you update the submission data to refer to the name and relative path of these files in the ZIP archive.

4. If you are adding new packages or images for the submission, upload the ZIP archive to the SAS URI that was provided in the response body of the POST method you called in step 2. For more information, see [Shared Access Signatures, Part 2: Create and use a SAS with Blob storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/storage-dotnet-shared-access-signature-part-2/).

  The following code snippet demonstrates how to upload the archive using the [CloudBlockBlob](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/microsoft.windowsazure.storage.blob.cloudblockblob.aspx) class in the Azure Storage Client Library for .NET.

  ```csharp
  string sasUrl = "https://productingestionbin1.blob.core.windows.net/ingestion/26920f66-b592-4439-9a9d-fb0f014902ec?sv=2014-02-14&sr=b&sig=usAN0kNFNnYE2tGQBI%2BARQWejX1Guiz7hdFtRhyK%2Bog%3D&se=2016-06-17T20:45:51Z&sp=rwl";

  Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob.CloudBlockBlob blockBob =
      new Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob.CloudBlockBlob(new System.Uri(sasUrl));
  await blockBob.UploadFromStreamAsync(stream);
  ```

5. Commit the submission by executing the following method. This will alert Dev Center that you are done with your submission and that your updates should now be applied to your account. For more information, see [Commit an app submission](commit-an-app-submission.md).

  ```
  POST https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/applications/{applicationId}/submissions/{submissionId}/commit
  ```

6. Check on the commit status by executing the following method. For more information, see [Get the status of an app submission](get-status-for-an-app-submission.md).

    ```
    GET https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/applications/{applicationId}/submissions/{submissionId}/status
    ```

    To confirm the submission status, review the *status* value in the response body. This value should change from **CommitStarted** to either **PreProcessing** if the request succeeds or to **CommitFailed** if there are errors in the request. If there are errors, the *statusDetails* field contains further details about the error.

7. After the commit has successfully completed, the submission is sent to the Store for ingestion. You can continue to monitor the submission progress by using the previous method, or by visiting the Dev Center dashboard.

## Resources

These methods use the following resources to format data.
