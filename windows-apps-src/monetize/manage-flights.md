>**Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;These methods can only be used for Windows Dev Center accounts that have been given permission to use the Windows Store submission API. Not all accounts have this permission enabled. These methods can only be used to get, create, or delete package flights. To create submissions for package flights, see the methods in [Manage package flight submissions](manage-flight-submissions.md).
