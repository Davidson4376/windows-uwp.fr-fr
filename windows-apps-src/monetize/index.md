# Monetize your app


\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \]

Windows supports free apps, app trials (both time-based and feature-based), paid apps, and in-app products. Your Windows app can use these features to let your customers try your app for free and choose what works for them. The topics in this section show you how to build these features into your app.

For details about the fees charged by the Windows Store and how you get paid for the money your app makes, see [Getting paid](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt148536).

| [Exclude or limit features in a trial version](exclude-or-limit-features-in-a-trial-version-of-your-app.md) | If you enable customers to use your app for free during a trial period, you can entice your customers to upgrade to the full version of your app by excluding or limiting some features during the trial period. Determine which features should be limited before you begin coding, then make sure that your app only allows them to work when a full license has been purchased. You can also enable features, such as banners or watermarks, that are shown only during the trial, before a customer buys your app. |
| [Enable in-app product purchases](enable-in-app-product-purchases.md)                                       | Whether your app is free or not, you can sell content, other apps, or new app functionality (such as unlocking the next level of a game) from right within the app. Here we show you how to enable these products in your app.    |
| [Add ads to apps with Microsoft Advertising](add-ads-to-apps-with-microsoft-advertising.md)      | Make more money from your Windows apps by including video and banner ads from Microsoft Advertising. The ads show in Windows apps for PCs, tablets, and phones. You can monitor your ad performance in real time by using the Windows Dev Center dashboard.   |
| [Use ad mediation to maximize revenue](use-ad-mediation-to-maximize-revenue.md)                           | Microsoft provides support for ad mediation, which lets you optimize your in-app advertising revenue by mediating banner ad requests from multiple ad networks. Different ad networks may have their own strengths, with some having a higher cost per thousand views (eCPM) or higher fill rate (percentage of ads served when your app makes a request) in certain markets than others. With a single ad network, you may end up with unfilled ad requests, causing you to lose potential revenue. Ad mediation helps you maximize your ad monetization by making sure you are always showing a live ad.  |
| [Use Windows Store services](using-windows-store-services.md)                                    | The Windows Store exposes several services that you can call via REST APIs to programmatically access certain types of data for apps that are registered to your or your organization's Windows Dev Center account.    |
