# Monetization, customer engagement, and Store services




The Windows SDK, the Microsoft Store Services SDK, and the Windows Store provide features that enable you to make more money from your apps and gain customers by engaging with your users. The topics in this section show you how to build these features into your app.

For details about the fees charged by the Windows Store and how you get paid for the money your app makes, see [Getting paid](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt148536).

| [In-app purchases and trials](in-app-purchases-and-trials.md)      | Learn how to use APIs in the Windows SDK to add in-app product purchases and trial functionality to your apps: <ul><li>Whether your app is free or not, you can sell content, other apps, or new app functionality (such as unlocking the next level of a game) from right within the app.</li><li>If you enable customers to use your app for free during a trial period, you can entice your customers to purchase the full version of your app by excluding or limiting some features during the trial period. You can also enable features, such as banners or watermarks, that are shown only during the trial, before a customer buys your app.</li></ul>  |
| [Microsoft Store Services SDK](microsoft-store-services-sdk.md)      | The Microsoft Store Services SDK provides libraries and tools that you can use to add features to your apps that help you make more money and engage with your customers. These features include in-app ads, A/B tests, and launching Feedback Hub from your app. |

| [Run experiments with A/B testing](run-app-experiments-with-a-b-testing.md)      |   Run A/B tests in your Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps to measure the effectiveness of features on some customers before you release the features to everyone. This feature requires the Microsoft Store Services SDK.  |
| [Launch Feedback Hub from your app](launch-feedback-hub-from-your-app.md)      |   Add code to your UWP apps to direct your Windows 10 customers to Feedback Hub, where they can submit problems, suggestions, and upvotes. Then, manage this feedback in the Dev Center dashboard. This feature requires the Microsoft Store Services SDK.   |
