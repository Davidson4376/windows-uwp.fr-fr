# Manage add-ons using the Windows Store submission API




Use the following methods in the Windows Store submission API to manage add-ons (also known as in-app products or IAPs) for apps that are registered to your Windows Dev Center account. For an introduction to the Windows Store submission API, see [Create and manage submissions using Windows Store services](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md).

>**Note**&nbsp;&nbsp;These methods can only be used for Windows Dev Center accounts that have been given permission to use the Windows Store submission API. Not all accounts have this permission enabled. These methods can only be used to get, create, or delete add-ons. To create submissions for add-ons, see the methods in [Manage add-on submissions](manage-add-on-submissions.md).

| Method        | URI    | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| GET | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/inappproducts``` | Gets data for all add-ons for all the apps that are registered to your Windows Dev Center account. For more information, see [Get all add-ons](get-all-add-ons.md). |
| GET | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/inappproducts/{inAppProductId} ``` | Gets data for a specific add-on. For more information, see [Get an add-on](get-an-add-on.md). |
| POST | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/inappproducts``` | Creates a new add-on. For more information, see [Create an add-on](create-an-add-on.md).  |
| DELETE | ```https://manage.devcenter.microsoft.com/v1.0/my/inappproducts/{inAppProductId}``` | Deletes an add-on. For more information, see [Delete an add-on](delete-an-add-on.md). |

## Prerequisites

If you have not done so already, complete all the [prerequisites](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md#prerequisites) for the Windows Store submission API before trying to use any of these methods.

## Resources

These methods use the following resources to format data.
