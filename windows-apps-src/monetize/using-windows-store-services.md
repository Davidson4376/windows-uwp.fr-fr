|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| [Access analytics data](access-analytics-data-using-windows-store-services.md) | Use the *Windows Store analytics API* to programmatically retrieve analytics data for apps that are registered to your or your organization's Windows Dev Center account. This API enables you to retrieve data for app and add-on (also known as in-app product or IAP) acquisitions, app failures, app ratings and reviews. |
| [Create and manage submissions](create-and-manage-submissions-using-windows-store-services.md) | Use the *Windows Store submission API* to programmatically query and create submissions for apps, add-ons and package flights for your or your organization's Windows Dev Center account. This API is useful if your account manages many apps or add-ons, and you want to automate and optimize the submission process for these assets. |
| [View and grant products from a service](view-and-grant-products-from-a-service.md)  | If you have a catalog of apps and add-ons, you can use the *Windows Store collection API* and *Windows Store purchase API* to access ownership information for these products from your services.  |
