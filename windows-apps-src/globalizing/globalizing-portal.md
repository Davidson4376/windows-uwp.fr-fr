# Globalization and localization




Windows is used worldwide, by audiences that vary in culture, region, and language. A user may speak any language, or even multiple languages. A user may be located anywhere in the world, and may speak any language in any location. You can increase the potential market for your app by designing it to be readily adaptable using *globalization* and *localization*.

**Globalization** is the process of designing and developing your app to act appropriately for different global markets without any changes or customization.

For example, you can:

-   Design the layout of your app to accommodate the different text lengths and font sizes of other languages in labels and text strings.
-   Retrieve text and culture-dependent images from resources that can be adapted to different local markets, instead of hard-coding them into your app's code or markup.
-   Use globalization APIs to display data that are formatted differently in different regions, such as numeric values, dates, times, and currencies.

**Localization** is the process of adapting your app to meet the language, cultural, and political requirements of a specific local market.

For example:

-   Translate the text and labels of the app for the new market, and create separate resources for its language.
-   Modify any culture-dependent images as necessary, and place in separate resources.
