# Cortana interactions in UWP apps


\[ Updated for UWP apps on Windows 10. For Windows 8.x articles, see the [archive](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=619132) \]

Extend the basic functionality of **Cortana** with voice commands that launch and execute a single action in an external application.


**Other speech components**

-   See the [Speech design guidelines](speech-interactions.md) if integrating speech recognition and text-to-speech (also known as TTS, or speech synthesis) directly into your app.

**Note**  
A voice command is a single utterance with a specific intent, defined in a Voice Command Definition (VCD) file, directed at an installed app through **Cortana**.

A voice command definition can vary in complexity. It can support anything from a single, constrained utterance to a collection of more flexible, natural language utterances, all denoting the same intent.

A VCD file defines one or more voice commands, each with a unique intent.

The target app can be launched in the foreground (the app takes focus and **Cortana** is dismissed) or activated in the background (**Cortana** retains focus but provides results from the app), depending on the complexity of the interaction. For example, voice commands that require additional context or user input are best handled in a foreground app, while basic commands can be handled in **Cortana** through a background app.

 

By integrating the basic functionality of your app, and providing a central entry point for the user to accomplish most of the tasks without opening your app directly, **Cortana** becomes a liaison between your app and the user. Providing this shortcut to app functionality and reducing the need to switch apps can save the user significant time and effort.
