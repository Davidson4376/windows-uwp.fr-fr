Here, we specify various [**Timeouts**](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/dn653253) values:

-   InitialSilenceTimeout - The length of time that a SpeechRecognizer detects silence (before any recognition results have been generated) and assumes speech input is not forthcoming.
-   BabbleTimeout - The length of time that a SpeechRecognizer continues to listen to unrecognizable sounds (babble) before it assumes speech input has ended and finalizes the recognition operation.
-   EndSilenceTimeout - The length of time that a SpeechRecognizer detects silence (after recognition results have been generated) and assumes speech input has ended.

**Note**  Timeouts can be set on a per-recognizer basis.

 

```CSharp
// Set timeout settings.
recognizer.Timeouts.InitialSilenceTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(6.0);
recognizer.Timeouts.BabbleTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(4.0);
recognizer.Timeouts.EndSilenceTimeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1.2);
```
