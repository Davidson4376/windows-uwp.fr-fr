# Tiles, badges, and notifications for UWP apps

Learn how to use tiles, badges, toasts, and notifications to provide entry points into your app and keep users up-to-date.

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="images/tile-and-live-tile.png" />
A tile is an app's representation on the Start menu. Every UWP app has a tile. You can enable different tile sizes (small, medium, wide, and large).</p>

<p>You can use a <em>tile notification</em> to update the tile to communicate new information to the user, such as news headlines, or the subject of the most recent unread message.</p>

<p>You can use a <em>badge</em> to provide status or summary info in the form of a system-provided glyph or a number from 1-99. Badges also appear on the task bar icon for an app. </p>

<p>A <em>toast notification</em> is a notification that your app sends to the user via a pop-up UI element called a <em>toast</em> (or <em>banner</em>). The notification can be seen whether the user is in your app or not.</p>
<p>A <em>push notification</em> or <em>raw notification</em> is a notification sent to your app either from Windows Push Notification Services (WNS) or from a background task. Your app can respond to these notifications either by notifying the user that something of interest happened (via badge update, tile update, or toast) or it can respond in any way of your choice.</p>
