| [Create an NFC Smart Card app](host-card-emulation.md)   | Windows Phone 8.1 supported NFC card emulation apps using a SIM-based secure element, but that model required secure payment apps to be tightly coupled with mobile-network operators (MNO). This limited the variety of possible payment solutions by other merchants or developers that are not coupled with MNOs. In Windows 10 Mobile, we have introduced a new card emulation technology called, Host Card Emulation (HCE). This article serves as a guide to develop an HCE app.   |
